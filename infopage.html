                    <p class="infopar">This website is intended as a learning tool for educators. It can be used to input a question, receive an answer from ChatGPT,
                        and be informed of characteristics of this answer. Viewing this information should help you familiarise yourself with how
                        ChatGPT might answer the question you inputted. AI detecting tools can be unreliable, so being able to pick out answers that 
                        look like ChatGPT's work yourself is a useful skill to have today.

                    <p class="infopar">Go to the main page using the button in the top left, and input a question in the white box. When you click the <b>Submit Question</b> button, you will receive information
                        about how ChatGPT answered your question.

                <p class="infopar">When you input a question, the information you receive on the website is intended to help you to understand how ChatGPT
                    is answering your question, and to identify the style in which it writes when answering your question. This information will
                    hopefully help you to identify ChatGPT-written answers submitted by students that you assign the question to.

                    <h4 class="infoheading2">ChatGPT's Answer</h4>
                    <p class="infopar">You are provided with ChatGPT's answer to your question. This answer actually comes from a version of ChatGPT that is asked
                        to answer questions as if writing on a school exam. This keeps irrelevant fluff words out of the answer such as asking how it can assist you further.
                        Viewing this answer on its own might help you see how ChatGPT tends to answer your question. Is it providing a list of bullet points? A large number of short sentences, or
                        a only a couple of long ones? This is the kind of thing that might help you identify answers that are turned in to you by students who have used ChatGPT to write them.

                    <p class="infopar">You are shown a list of the top 10 most relevant key words or phrases in ChatGPT's answer. Reading this list can be 
                        a quick way to get the gist of what ChatGPT tends to bring up when answering your question.

                    <h4 class="infoheading2">Sentiment Analysis</h4>
                    <p class="infopar">You are given a sentiment analysis of ChatGPT's answer, consisting of the word Positive, Neutral, or Negative.
                        This can give you an idea of what stance ChatGPT tends to take on your question. Answers that have a similar sentiment may also be likely to be ChatGPT-generated, and vice versa.

                <div class="bigboxparcontainer">
                    <h4 class="infoheading2">Average Sentence Length</h4>
                    <p class="infopar">You are shown the average sentence length of ChatGPT's answer. ChatGPT will tend to constantly use sentences of similar length in its answer.
                        If you see another answer that tends to keep using sentences of around that length, it might be generated by ChatGPT. Conversely, answers
                        that throw in a lot of sentences of varying length, or use extremely run-on sentences, may be less likely to be from ChatGPT.

                    <h4 class="infoheading2">Flesch Reading Ease Score</h4>
                    <p class="infopar">You are given the Flesch Reading Ease Score of ChatGPT's answer. This is a number between 0 and 100, with 0 being
                        hardest to read and 100 being easiest. This test is used internationally to determine the ease of readability of <b>plain English</b> texts.
                        This can give you an idea of the level at which ChatGPT tends to write when answering your question. If a student turns in an answer that is more similar
                        to the standard of ChatGPT's writing than their own, it might be that they have used  ChatGPT.

                    <p class="infopar">Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is a similar test, designed to return a score that corresponds to the grade level of the writing. 
                        For your convenience the grade level is translated to the corresponding year of school in the Irish system. This result gives you a similar idea to
                        the Flesch Reading Ease score, but taking both into consideration can give you a clearer view of how ChatGPT tends to write when answering your question.

                <h3 class="infoheading1">More Info</h3>
                <p class="infopar">Although ChatGPT will often answer the same question similarly, it is non-deterministic, so your answer, list of key words, and
                    average sentence length may vary when repeatedly inputting the same question. If you really want to know a lot about how ChatGPT will
                    answer a particular question, it's recommended that you input the same question 2 or 3 times to see how the answer may vary, or reword
                    and rework your question to see how ChatGPT alters its answer in response. Eventually, you may even learn to formulate questions
                    that make it particularly easy to identify when ChatGPT has generated the answer, increasing how reliably you can identify these answers.
